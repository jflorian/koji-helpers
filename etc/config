[gojira]
# Presently there are no options for gojira.

# However, you must define a section for each Koji buildroot tag that has
# dependencies on external package repositories.  The section name must begin
# with `buildroot ` plus the name of the Koji buildroot tag.  Each such
# buildroot section should look like the following example:

;[buildroot f25-build]
;arches = i386,x86_64
;dependencies = https://example.com/mirrors/fedora/releases/25/Everything/$basearch/os,https://example.com/mirrors/fedora/updates/25/$basearch



[smashd]
# repo_dir is the name of the directory that is to be synchronized with the
# repository tree composited from each of the mashed repositories.  This
# must be an absolute path and typically would be the longest path that all
# package repositories have in common.
;repo_dir = /mnt/rpms

# exclude_tags is a space-separated list of tags which smashd should ignore.
;exclude_tags = trashcan


# You must also define a section for each package repository.  The section
# name must begin with `repository ` plus the name of a Koji tag which
# indicates the disposition of builds having that tag.  Builds may have more
# than one such tag which would cause smashd to place that package in more
# than one repository, if desired.  Builds not having any such tag are
# excluded from the package repositories.  Each such repository section should
# look like the following example:

;[repository f25-testing]
;mash_path = fedora/testing/25
;gpg_key_id = A9B8C7D6
;sigul_key_name = fedora_25
;sigul_key_pass = SuperSecretSigningPassphrase
