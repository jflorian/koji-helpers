# repo_dir is the name of the directory that is to be synchronized with the

# Once smashd does detect new tag events, it will start a countdown timer for
# quiescent_period seconds.  If additional new tag events occur during this
# period, smashd will restart the countdown timer.  Only once the countdown
# timer expires without any further new tag events will smashd begin to act
# upon the events.  Mashing can be an intensive process and this parameter
# allows you to strike a balance between a responsive smashd process without
# overly abusing resources.  A value of zero will defeat this feature.

# You must also define a section for each package repository.  The section
# name must begin with `repository ` plus the name of a Koji tag which
# indicates the disposition of builds having that tag.  Builds may have more
# than one such tag which would cause smashd to place that package in more
# than one repository, if desired.  Builds not having any such tag are
# excluded from the package repositories.  Each such repository section should
# look like the following example:
